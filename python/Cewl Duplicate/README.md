Define a function that cleans the text found within the search results. Also notating the limit of 4 characters to avoid words that dont matter.
REGEX usage here "re.findall" Finds all word-like patterns (\b\w+\b)
The limit isÂ  \b meaning what the word is bound to, and \w+ matches any word 
Filtering Words: The programmer limits the words to those that have at least 4 characters. This avoids common small words (e.g., "the", "is", "on") that aren't very useful for word frequency analysis.
