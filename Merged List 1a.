# A project to merge txt lists.
# Can be useful if information is known about the target hash or target.
# This can be used to more accurately spread the net over a custom list and a bigger list like Rock you or a much larger wordlist.


# Need to fix codec issues with lists over 5gigs.
# Need to resolve prompting the user to add which lists to they want to merge.
# Currently is super inefficient due to needing to adjust the code and find the DIR of the txt list.
