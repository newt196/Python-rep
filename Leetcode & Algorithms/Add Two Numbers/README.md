# Add Two Numbers as Linked Lists

## Problem Statement

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit. Your task is to add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

### Assumptions
- The two numbers do not contain any leading zeros, except for the number 0 itself.

## Key Points
- **Non-Empty Lists**: The input lists are already provided, so you don't need to worry about creating them from scratch.
  
- **Linked Lists**: These data structures allow efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays. Linked lists can also be used to implement other structures like stacks, queues, and deques.

- **Reverse Order**: The digits of the numbers are stored in reverse order, which is crucial for the addition logic.

## Final Product
- The objective is to add the two numbers represented by the linked lists and return the sum as a new linked list.

### Input Example
```python
l1 = [2, 4, 3]  # Represents the number 342
l2 = [5, 6, 4]  # Represents the number 465
