Just learned that you have to hit submit ðŸ˜¡ to pass the leetcode problem ðŸ˜¡.

Now need to go through each existing problem to make sure they pass each leetocde solution given and don't exceed the time limit. 

**Leetcode systematic approach**

1. Simplify the problem

Given input change the answer into a given output:
The inputs are these 
and here are the results

Catch the edge cases apparently. 

Further explaining how we can ask "leet" further questions in regards to the problem.

2. Pattern recognition

Restraints give out what the constraints should be.
More details at the big O given in the constraints.

Need a chat explanation, because he goes off of a pattern given in a subscription i do not have.

**We need to find a algo or a solution to the given problem.
Hopefully a algorithm for quicker action.
** 

3. Implementation plan

From my understanding we are just adjusting a default known or written down algorithm and adjusting it to the 
code problem.

Adjusting the code to fit the needed solution
this means we are going through the code block and adjusting it to the constraints, use cases, and solutions.

4. Coding time

Line by line after the algorithm to adjust for a given problem to solution. 

5. Debug

2 types of error
Syntax: code doesn't run
Implementation error: runs but test fail (edge case consideration)
